Maintainer notes
================

If only generating the ".orig.tar.gz" file is needed, simply run:

    uscan

Fetch a new version of the upstream tarball, merge it into the
"upstream" branch and then merge "upstream" into the "master" branch:

    gbp import-orig --uscan

Building:

    gbp buildpackage
